gs112	3.5			Haplogroup I2 (Y-DNA)	This indicates a paternal blood line which originated approximately 22,000 years ago along the Eastern Adriatic Sea coast. This is typical of people of Southeastern Europe origins such as Bosnians, Croats, Sardinians, Ukrainians and Serbs. The criteria checks up to two different markers of which you must have the mutation defining this haplogroup for each marker you have results for. You must have matching results for at least one marker. You also must match gs196 for Haplogroup I (Y-DNA). Only one match is required because not every service tests for all markers or your results may have a no-call for a marker. Any one marker should be a reliable indication of the haplogroup. To prevent false positives it also makes sure you do not have the non-mutated variant in all markers for which you ...

Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks your own body's insulin producing cells in the pancreas, preventing your blood sugar from being able to enter cells that need energy. This has been verified for white people. 23andMe originally wanted to use rs9272346 instead, but it was deemed unreliable.

rs5882(A;A)	2.0	Bad	44.2%	Faster aging. Increased risk for Dementia. Less good cholesterol.	Faster aging. Increased risk for Dementia. Less good cholesterol.  This reduces HDL ('good') cholesterol. HDL cholesterol removes cholesterol from artery walls and improves health. This SNP seems to be associated with higher blood pressure, less longevity, and more diseases of aging, in particular memory decline and dementia, and lower odds of living to 100, especially in Ashkenazi Jews. Attempting to raise HDL cholesterol may be useful to mitigate the effects of this SNP. If you are concerned about longevity you may want to support the SENS Research Foundation, and Aubrey de Grey, who are working on cures for aging, or you may want to join the Life Extension Foundation.

Fasting Plasma Glucose is the amount of sugar in your blood when you wake up. It's required to power your body, but too much is very bad for you. Fasting plasma glucose between 5.6 mmol/L and 6.9 mmol/L (101 &#8211; 125 mg/dl) is considered pre-diabetes. Fasting plasma glucose higher than 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dl) is considered diabetes.

Associated with: Restless legs syndrome. This SNP, located in an intron of the BTBD9 gene, has a variant that is seen somewhat more frequently in individuals with restless legs syndrome. The risk allele is rs3923809(A); carriers of two such alleles, i.e. those with rs3923809(A;A) genotypes, are estimated to be 1.9 fold more likely to have restless legs syndrome than rs3923809(G;G) individuals. The authors of this study suggest that perhaps half of the cases of restless legs syndrome may involve the rs3923809 risk genotypes. Note that 70-80% of all individuals in European populations carry one or two copies of the (A) major allele, yet restless legs syndrome is thought to affect less than 10...

Alcohol Flush: Normal, doesn't flush. Normal hangovers. Normal risk of Alcoholism. Normal risk of Esophageal Cancer. Disulfiram is effective for alcoholism.  Two working copies of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH2) mean you won't turn bright red when you drink alcohol, unlike most Asians. After your body turns alcohol into the dangerous acetaldehyde, this gene quickly turns the acetaldehyde into vinegar. It also stops the acetaldehyde in cigarettes from causing Esophageal Cancer. It reduces hangovers compared to Asians, but less hangovers and flushing obviously increases the risk of alcoholism. Alcoholism can be treated effectively with the drug Disulfiram (Antabuse) which would stop this gene from working and cause the Asian flush in non-Asians.

The most specific subclade match is the most significant. The criteria checks up to five different markers of which you must have the mutation defining this haplogroup for each marker you have results for. You must have matching results for at least one marker. Only one match is required because not every service tests for all markers or your results may have a no-call for a marker. Any one marker should be a reliable indication of the haplogroup. To prevent false positives it also makes sure you do not have the non-mutated variant in all markers for which you have results. A study of 3,000+ British men concluded that carriers of haplogroup I had about a 50% higher age-adjusted risk of coronary ar...

Of concern, EE appears to be a growing health problem with an annual incidence of at least 1 in 10,000 children (5). The primary symptoms of EE (chest and abdominal pain, dysphagia, heartburn, vomiting, and food impaction) are also observed in patients with chronic esophagitis (CE) including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (6&#8211;8). However, in contrast to GERD, EE occurs more frequently in males (80%), appears to have a common familial form, has a high rate of associated atopic disease (70%), and is typically associated with a normal pH probe recording of the esophagus (5, 9, 10) In the 3? untrans...

rs1861046(G;G)	1.0		92.9%		Conduct disorder (CD) is one of the most prevalent childhood psychiatric conditions, and is associated with a number of serious concomitant and future problems. CD symptomatology is known to have a considerable genetic component, with heritability estimates in the range of 50%. Four SNPs reached genome-wide significance with CD symptom count, based on P &lt; 5x10^-8 Two of these SNPs (rs16891867 and rs1861046) were in the gene C1QTNF7 (C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein 7). These SNPs were in high LD (r^2=0.97). The other top two SNPs meeting genome-wide significance were intergenic and located on chromosomes 11 and 13. Alleles A/G were found to be associated with CD symptom count or CD case status. [http://www.downstate.edu/hbnl/documents/2010-Dick-Genome-wideassociationstudyof...
